You 1
know 1
how 1
certain 1
kinds 1
of 1
music 1
will 1
beat 1
everything 1
out 1
of 1
your 1
consciousness 1
except 1
a 1
wild 1
delirium 1
of 1
joy; 1
how 1
love 1
of 1
a 1
woman 1
will 1
take 1
up 1
every 1
cranny 1
of 1
space 1
in 1
your 1
being,--and 1
fill 1
the 1
universe 1
beside,--so 1
that 1
people 1
who 1
are 1
not 1
en 1
rapport 1
with 1
the 1
strains 1
that 1
delight 1
you, 1
or 1
with 1
the 1
beauty 1
that 1
enthralls 1
you, 1
seem 1
pitiable 1
creatures, 1
not 1
in 1
touch 1
with 1
the 1
Divine 1
Harmony, 1
with 1
Supreme 1
Loveliness. 1
So 1
it 1
was 1
with 1
me, 1
when 1
I 1
set 1
my 1
feet 1
on 1
Mars! 1
My 1
soul 1
leaped 1
to 1
its 1
highest 1
altitude 1
and 1
I 1
had 1
but 1
one 1
vast 1
thought,--"I 1
have 1
triumphed; 1
I 1
am 1
here! 1
And 1
I 1
am 1
alone; 1
Earth 1
is 1
unconscious 1
of 1
the 1
glory 1
that 1
is 1
mine!" 1
I 1
shall 1
not 1
weary 1
you 1
with 1
an 1
account 1
of 1
my 1
voyage, 1
since 1
you 1
are 1
more 1
interested 1
in 1
the 1
story 1
of 1
my 1
sojourn 1
on 1
the 1
red 1
planet 1
than 1
in 1
the 1
manner 1
of 1
my 1
getting 1
there. 1
It 1
is 1
not 1
literally 1
red, 1
by 1
the 1
way; 1
that 1
which 1
makes 1
it 1
appear 1
so 1
at 1
this 1
distance 1
is 1
its 1
atmosphere,--its 1
"sky,"--which 1
is 1
of 1
a 1
soft 1
roseate 1
color, 1
instead 1
of 1
being 1
blue 1
like 1
ours. 1
It 1
is 1
as 1
beautiful 1
as 1
a 1
blush. 1
I 1
will 1
just 1
say, 1
that 1
the 1
time 1
consumed 1
in 1
making 1
the 1
journey 1
was 1
incredibly 1
brief. 1
Having 1
launched 1
my 1
aeroplane 1
on 1
the 1
current 1
of 1
attraction 1
which 1
flows 1
uninterruptedly 1
between 1
this 1
world 1
and 1
that, 1
traveling 1
was 1
as 1
swift 1
as 1
thought. 1
My 1
impression 1
is 1
that 1
my 1
speed 1
was 1
constantly 1
accelerated 1
until 1
I 1
neared 1
my 1
journey's 1
end, 1
when 1
the 1
planet's 1
pink 1
envelope 1
interposed 1
its 1
soft 1
resistance 1
to 1
prevent 1
a 1
destructive 1
landing. 1
